# OpenBound
Free your work. Learn more. 


### The big idea
If Khan Academy, Open MIT, and Blackboard (etc!) are turning the classroom inside out, we want to turn it upside down. We think the work of the classroom should be free.


### The stack
Ruby on Rails. Javascript. MySQL. Deploy and storage on Amazon EC2 and S3. Deploys with Rubber. 


### Contributing
Got an idea? Make a pull request. An improvement? Pull request. Random idea. Pull request. We deploy at least weekly. 

Catch a bug? Make an issue. Want to send a random message with too many emojis to fit in a pull request? Make an issue. 


### The wiki
- references for how-to type instructions for basic commands for MySQL, Rails, and Git. 
- instructions for how to install a development version, how to deploy, how to use git as a member of a team, and, erm, tests. 

The Wiki is a a standalone git repository. Contributions very welcome.
